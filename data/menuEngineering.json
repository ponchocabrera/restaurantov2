    "title": "The Science Behind Restaurant Menu Design",
    "introduction": "Menus are more than just a list of dishes and prices; they are a powerful tool that can significantly influence customer choices and, ultimately, a restaurant's success. Understanding the science behind menu design helps restaurant owners create menus that are visually appealing and strategically effective in driving sales and enhancing the dining experience.",
